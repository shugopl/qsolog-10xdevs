Step 12: Admin panel – browse all users (ADMIN-only).

Goal
- Add an ADMIN-only capability to view (browse) all registered users in the system.
- Admin must be able to open an “Admin / Users” screen and see a list of saved users.

Constraints / Non-goals
- Do NOT expose sensitive fields (password hashes, tokens).
- This step is read-only: no create/edit/delete users required.
- Keep the UI consistent with existing Angular Material layout.

Backend (Spring WebFlux)
- Add an ADMIN-protected endpoint:
  - GET `/api/v1/admin/users`
  - Returns a list/stream of users as DTOs (at minimum: `id`, `email`, `username`, `role`).
  - Response can reuse `UserResponse` or introduce a dedicated `AdminUserResponse` if you want to add `createdAt` later.
- Implement controller + service using existing `UserRepository`:
  - `userRepository.findAll()` -> map to DTO.
- Secure the endpoint so ONLY admins can call it:
  - Update `SecurityConfig` to include a rule before the generic authenticated rules:
    - `.pathMatchers("/api/v1/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")`
  - Ensure the JWT role mapping is used (already produces `ROLE_<role>` authority).
- Add minimal tests (if present in project conventions):
  - Non-authenticated request -> 401
  - Authenticated OPERATOR -> 403
  - Authenticated ADMIN -> 200 and returns user list

Frontend (Angular)
- Add an Admin-only route and screen:
  - Route: `/admin/users`
  - Component: `AdminUsersComponent` under something like `features/admin/users/`
- Add an Admin guard:
  - Uses `AuthService.currentUser$` (loaded via `/auth/me`) and checks `user.role === 'ADMIN'`.
  - If authenticated but not admin -> redirect to `/qso` (or a dedicated “Not authorized” page if you already have one).
- Add a service method to fetch users:
  - `GET {environment.apiBaseUrl}/admin/users`
  - Types: create `AdminUser` interface mirroring backend DTO (`id/email/username/role`).
- UI requirements:
  - Display users in Angular Material table (`MatTable`) with columns:
    - Username, Email, Role (and optionally ID in a secondary/tooltip column).
  - Add loading + error state (simple `mat-progress-bar` + `mat-error`/message).
  - Add a navigation entry in `LayoutComponent` side menu:
    - Show “Users” only when current user role is ADMIN.

Acceptance criteria
- When logged in as ADMIN, opening `/admin/users` shows the full list of users.
- When logged in as OPERATOR, `/admin/users` is blocked (redirect or 403 handled gracefully).
- Backend endpoint is not accessible anonymously and not accessible to non-admin users.
- No sensitive data is returned by the API.
