Step 8: Implement AI helper module as suggestion-only.

Endpoints:
POST /api/v1/ai/qso-description
Request: QSO-like payload (theirCallsign, date/time, band, mode, rst, qth, notes)
Response: {language:"PL|EN", text:"..."}  (user chooses language)
- Default implementation: deterministic mock text (no external key needed).
- Optional "openai" profile implementation behind env OPENAI_API_KEY.

POST /api/v1/ai/period-report?from=&to=&lang=PL|EN
- Backend computes stats (reuse Step5 service) then AI turns it into narrative text.
- Save generated report into ai_report_history table.
GET /api/v1/ai/reports?from=&to=  (history list)
GET /api/v1/ai/reports/{id}

Rules:
- AI never auto-writes into QSO notes; it returns suggestions. UI decides.
- Keep tone neutral/loose.
- App must run without OpenAI.

Tests:
- mock generator returns text
- history is persisted
STOP after Step 8.
