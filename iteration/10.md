Step 10: Implement feature screens.

QSO list:
- MatTable + paginator + filters (callsign contains, band select, date range).
- actions: edit/delete.

QSO form:
- required fields according to MVP.
- band required; frequency optional.
- mode select from enum list + “Other/custom” optional field if enabled (store as customMode only if needed; backend can ignore for MVP or store in notes/vendor later).
- On callsign blur: call /suggestions and prefill name/qth/notes (user can override).
- On save: handle duplicate 409 response by showing dialog “potential duplicate” and re-submit with confirmDuplicate=true if user confirms.

Stats:
- call /stats/summary and render charts (pick a simple, stable chart library or basic visualization).
- show all vs confirmed.

AI:
- On QSO form: button “Generate description (PL/EN)”, show returned text with “Copy to notes” button.
- Reports screen: pick date range + lang -> call /ai/period-report, show text, and list history.

Frontend mode selection:
- Provide a single dropdown with common modes shown as friendly labels:
  CW, SSB, AM, FM, RTTY, PSK31, FT8, FT4, JS8, Other(Custom)
- Map selections:
  PSK31 -> mode=PSK, submode=PSK31
  FT8/FT4/JS8 -> mode=MFSK, submode=FT8/FT4/JS8
  Others (CW/SSB/AM/FM/RTTY) -> mode=<that>, submode=null
  Other(Custom) -> mode=DATA, submode=null, customMode=<user text>

STOP after Step 10.
