Step 7: Implement callsign lookup and suggestions.

Endpoints:
GET /api/v1/lookup/{callsign}
- Calls HamQTH (or configurable base URL) and returns normalized data (name, qth, grid, country if available).
- Add simple cache (in-memory with TTL) and rate limiting backoff to avoid spamming API.
- Never persist lookup results into QSO automatically.

GET /api/v1/suggestions/callsign/{callsign}
- Query user’s past QSOs for this callsign and return:
  lastKnownName, lastKnownQth, lastNotesSnippet, mostCommonBand/mode (optional)
- This endpoint does not call HamQTH; it is “local history” suggestions.

Architecture:
- Domain port CallsignLookupPort + infra adapter HamQTH client.
- Provide mock adapter when HAMQTH credentials missing (app still runs).

Tests:
- suggestions works from DB history
- lookup uses mock when creds missing
STOP after Step 7.
