Step 4: Implement QSO CRUD and duplicate detection warning.

API:
POST   /api/v1/qso
GET    /api/v1/qso (filters: callsign contains, band, from,to; pagination page/size; sort by qsoDate desc/timeOn desc)
GET    /api/v1/qso/{id}
PUT    /api/v1/qso/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/qso/{id}

Validation:
- Required: theirCallsign, qsoDate, timeOn, band, mode.
- frequency_khz optional.
- UTC: qsoDate is date UTC, timeOn is time UTC.

Ownership:
- All operations scoped to authenticated user_id; never allow cross-user access.

Duplicate warning:
- On POST, check potential duplicate for same user:
  same theirCallsign + qsoDate + band + mode (+ optional timeOn rounded to 5 minutes).
- If found and request does NOT include confirmDuplicate=true, return 409 with ProblemDetails including a field:
  {"type":"duplicate_detected","existingIds":[...],"message":"Potential duplicate. Pass confirmDuplicate=true to force save."}
- If confirmDuplicate=true, save anyway.

DTO:
- Use request/response records.
- Keep mapping clean.

Tests:
- CRUD happy path
- ownership enforced
- duplicate detection triggers 409 and then allows save with confirmDuplicate=true

Verification: mvn test.

Validation additions:
- band must be one of Band enum values (ADIF band names)
- mode/submode mapping:
  - allow AdifMode alone OR (AdifMode + AdifSubmode) according to mapping rules
- customMode:
  - allowed only when mode==DATA and submode==null

STOP after Step 4.
